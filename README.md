## Mock framework for Python 2.x and 3.x, which has taken influence from jMock.

### Installing
```
pip install yamf
```

Best way to see the usage is to see the test code test_yamf.py


### Basic usage
To set basic expectation that doSomething must be called:
```
m = yamf.Mock()
m.doSomething.mustBeCalled
```
Method can be mocked also:
```
mockMethod = yamf.MockMethod()
mockMethod.mustBeCalled
```

To verify that the doSomething was called use:
```
m.verify()
The verify will raise assertion if the expectations are not met.
```

To verify that method is not called use:

```
m.doSomethingElse.mustNotBeCalled
````

### Call counts
To check that method is called certain times:

```
m.doSomething.mustBeCalled.once
m.doSomething.mustBeCalled.times(2)
m.doSomething.mustBeCalled.atLeastTimes(2)
````

### Arguments
To check arguments of the method:
```
m.doSomething.mustBeCalled.withArgs(5,2)
````

To check that method is called at least two times with specific args
```
m.doSomething.mustBeCalled.withArgs(5).mustBeCalled.withArgs(6)
```
To check that method is called two times with same args
```
m.doSomething.mustBeCalled.withArgs(5).times(2)
```

### Return value
To make a method to return value:
```
m.doSomething.returns(1)
```

This will also work
```
m.doSomething.mustBeCalled.once.returns(5)
```
### Executing
To execute something when mock method is called:
```
def method(a,b):
    #Do something. Note that the method return value is not given to caller

m.doSomething.execute(method) # execute takes callable
````

### History
To find out certain call's arguments:

```
#Somewhere mock gets called like
m.doSomething(1,k=2)
m.doSomething(5,k=6)

# calls will be [((1),{'k':2}), (5,{'k':6})]
calls = m.doSomething.history
`````

### Array of mocks
To handle situation where there are array of mocks:

```
mocks = MockArray(4)
mocks.method.mustBeCalled.times(2)

for mock in mocks: mock.method()
for mock in mocks: mock.method()

mocks.verify()
````

### Modules
To verify that certain module method is called

```
m = MockModule('os')
m.getcwd.mustBeCalled
# testing...
m.verify()
````

To make the module method to return value
```
m = MockModule('os')
m.getcwd.returns('abc123')
````

## 0.7 version
To verify all mocks at once. SHOULD NOT BE USED! HAS BUG SEE ISSUES

```
import yamf
m = yamf.Mock()
m2 = yamf.Mock()
yamf.verify()
```

To get errors when mock is accessing attributes that mocked class does not have

```
import yamf
m = yamf.Mock(MyClass)

m.method() # Generates assertion error if method is not MyClass's attribute
````

To return different values for different calls

```
import yamf
m = yamf.Mock()
m.method.returns(1).returns(2)
m.method() # returns 1
m.method() # returns 2
m.method() # returns 2
```
